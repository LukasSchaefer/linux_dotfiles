## Linux Dotfiles

This contains my dotfiles including config files for **X resources**, **i3**, **GTK**, **vim**, **zsh** and aliases.

The i3 and X-resources setup is based on [Manjaro i3](https://manjaro.org/download/community/i3/). Note that this is a community provided edition!

My zsh setup is based on [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

Additionally this includes some small scripts based on python, zsh and bash as well as some wallpapers
